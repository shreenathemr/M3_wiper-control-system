Over the past few years the automotive industry has aggressively researched ways to develop systems for safety, to save humans life. Generally working of a car wiper is based on manual switching. In this case the driver has to switch ON the power button to turn on the wiper. It complicate things because the driver has to concentrate simultaneously on driving and wiper. With drivers exposed to increased distraction, automatic rain sensing wiper system becomes more appealing feature, as they eliminate the risk and distraction to turn on the wiper manually. In this automatic wiper system, a rain sensor, microcontroller and a driver integrated circuit is used to convert manual operation into automatic operation. When water falls on the rain sensor, the sensor sends the signal to the microcontroller and then the microcontroller processes the data and energizes the driver IC to turn on the wiper. With these modifications automatic cleaning of the glass can be done without the involvement of the driver.
