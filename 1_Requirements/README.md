# Introduction
A windscreen wiper or  windshield wiper  is a  device used  to remove rain and debris from a windscreen.  Almost  all motor  vehicle,  including    trains,    aircraft  and watercraft, are equipped  with  such  wipers,  which  are  usually  an  essential requirement. A wiper generally consists of an arm, pivoting at one end and with a long rubber blade attached to the other.
In  the  present  automobiles  the  number  of  facilities  is much  higher.  The  driver  has  to  concentrate  on  road  while driving,  and   with    increased   traffic,   things   get    frustrating. The features in the car like GPRS to trace the route, music system,  air  condition  system  etc  may  drive  away  the attention  of  the  driver
# Features
- Wiper system which is handy and easy to use
- STM32F407 Controller ARM Cortex -M4 which is faster and contains superior and innovative peripherals
- Pushbutton to turn on ignition as well as to change the speed
- Three LEDs indicating the wiping operation
# SWOT Analysis
## Strength
- Safety for the driver as well as the passengers in the vehicle
- Clear Visibility to the Driver for neat ride.
- Wiper not stop in middle of Window
## Weakness
- The total cost of the wiper system is high if implemented in real-time.
- Required practical implementation
- Blades should be in rubber
## Opportunities
- Rain sensing and automatic operation can be implemented as further enhancement.
- Increase as wiper system is necessary to install.
## Threats
- Replacing the board is not possible if it malfunctions.
- Failure of operation might cause vesion problem while driving.
- Advance technology are replaced
# 4Ws and 1Hs
## Who
- All who wants safety and clean vision in weather conditions.
## What
- Aim is to implement automatic wiper system for vehicles.
## Why
- Curious about intrest in embedded system applications.
## When
- It is recommended to operate during dust or rain.
## How
- Ignition is turned on, the wiper starts its operation along with speed adjustment modes which improves overall operation.
